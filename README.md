# FaceRecognition_TransferLearning         

■ Using transfer learning, achieved extremely high test accuracy for a small training data set with no external preprocessing.       
■ Successfully developed a method to detect and recognize faces for arbitrary pictures with multiple faces, as well as tilted face.                
■ Computed picture similarity based on embedding space.
